# Health Risk Diagnosis Expert System with CLIPS

### About the program
This program lets user input their name, weight and height. It will then calculate the user's BMI and display the user's weight status. If the user is underweight or extremely 
obese, system will automatically schedule for doctor's appointment.
If user does not fall into those two categories, they will be prompted to enter whether they smoke. A health report containing health risks and user details will then be 
printed
